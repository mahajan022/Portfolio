      "description": "A biometric attendance system that integrates OpenCVâ€™s deep learning models with Firebase Authentication for real-time, secure attendance tracking. The system detects and recognizes faces with high accuracy using the OpenFace nn4.small2.v1.t7 model and an SVM classifier, ensuring seamless identification while effectively handling unknown faces. Firebase enables secure authentication, cloud-based data management, and real-time access to attendance records, making the system highly scalable. Additionally, it automates attendance logging, generates exportable reports (CSV/Excel), and provides an interactive GUI with a live camera feed for real-time tracking. With multi-platform accessibility and robust security, this system is an efficient and reliable solution for schools, offices, and smart access control applications..",
